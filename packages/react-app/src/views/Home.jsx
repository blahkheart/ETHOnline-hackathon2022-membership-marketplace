                As we explore the ever expansive brave new world of web3, new and exciting communities spawn up almost
                on a daily basis, some of which may align with our values and interests but there's one problem.

                  We don't know about them! We simply do not know they exist!!! Finding communities and projects or
                  services that excites us can be a daunting task in web3 simply becuase of how fast things are moving,
                  it's difficult to keep track or keep up with everything.

                Members Hub try to solve this by providing a platform where communities can broadcast their existence so
